# crypto-rs

A fast rust-based implementation of a simple cryptocurrency/blockchain using merkle trees and proof of work.



## Contribution Guide

Once cloned, a simple `cargo run` should install all of the necessary dependencies. 

Make sure that the rust build is nightly (`rustup default nightly`) before opening an issue.



## TODO/Done:

#### Block/Blockchain
